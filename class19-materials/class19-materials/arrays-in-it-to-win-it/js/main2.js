//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['movieOne', 'movieTwo', 'movieThree']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let movieOne = movies[0]


//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrlength = movies.length
console.log(arrlength);

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = movies[movies.length - 1]
